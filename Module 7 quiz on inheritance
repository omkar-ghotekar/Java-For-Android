1 / 1 point

super class
Student object
subclass

2. When creating a subclass

******************
Ans:-

only write the instance variables and methods that are added to the subclass.

**************************

3. Why do we aim to minimize the amount of code we have to write by not repeating code segments within a Java project? Check all that apply

******************
Ans:-

It improves readability, code is easier to trace when implementation details are found in only on location.

It makes debugging easier. Implementation details that only appear once in a project can be corrected or improved by editing in only one place.

It facilitates code reuse. An object that contains all of its state and behavior in a single file is "portable" and can be included in many different Java projects.
*****************************************


4. To make a call from a subclass to a public, overloaded method whose implementation details are in its super class,

*****************************
Ans:-

simply make the call. The unique return type and/or parameter list will enable the compiler to locate the implementation details.

*********************************

5. To make a call from a subclass to a public, overridden method whose implementation details are in its super class

**************************
Ans:-

you must precede the call with the keyword super to indicate which version of the method you are calling.
